Cleaning & Preparing the Ships Data before importing into Tableau 

Converted the ships.csv to Excel workbook
	Tableau does not accept CSV files but accepts Excel files.
Created a table in Excel with headers.
"Â" was present in every cell at the end of every word.
To remove all instances of this I used the replace function to find Â throughout my Excel file & replace it with a space. 
	This process cleaned up my sheet and made the words more uniform & recognizable.
A significant amount of ships did not have the launch year data available. 
I excluded it from the analysis & visualization so it doesn't skew results.


Cleaning & Preparing the Facilities Data before importing into Tableau 

Converted the facilities.csv to Excel workbook
	Tableau does not accept CSV files but accepts Excel files.
Created a table in Excel with headers.
"Â" was present in every cell at the end of every word.
To remove all instances of this I used the replace function to find Â throughout my Excel file & replace it with a space. 
	This process cleaned up my sheet and made the words more uniform & recognizable.
In my 'type' column i had different variables like Airfield, Army Base, Factory but i had some types that were multiple
which makes sense because some facilities were used for multiple purposes. For example, I had 2 Army Base, Prison Camp in the US,
also 3 Factory, Shipyard in the US. I could have created separate or temporary columns before importing them to Tableau.
Decided to leave it as is and visualize the Facilities that served several purposes.



Cleaning & Preparing the Events Data before importing into Tableau 

Converted the events.csv to Excel workbook
	Tableau does not accept CSV files but accepts Excel files.
Created a table in Excel with headers.
"Â" was present in every cell at the end of every word.
To remove all instances of this I used the replace function to find Â throughout my Excel file & replace it with a space. 
	This process cleaned up my sheet and made the words more uniform & recognizable.
Upon inspection of the dataset, I realized the Dates in my 'Date" column were not uniform.
Because some events took place in one day i had 2 variations of how dates were presented.
	I had dates like this: 16-Apr-22 & like this: 21 Jan 1930 - 22 Apr 1930
To create a uniform data structure, I decided to divide the columns using the "Text to Columns" feature in Excel.
I decided to use "fixed width" to create a break line in my column to separate the starting date from the end date.
So instead of 21 Jan 1930 - 22 Apr 1930 in one cell in my previous example after using the "Text to Columns" feature 
It created two columns with 21 Jan 1930 in the first column and - 22 Apr 1930.
For the cells with one date, it will put the date in the first column.
So now i have two columns which i titled Original Date & Last Date.
The dates in the last date column now have an extra hyphen in front of the date.
	Dates in my 'Last Date' column look like this now: - 22 Apr 1930
To remove this hyphen i had to use an Excel formula: =IF(LEFT(F2,1)="-", MID(F2, 3, LEN(F2)), D2)
This formula checks if the first character in the cell is a hyphen. If it is, it starts from the 3rd character 
(excluding the hyphen and the space after it) and takes the rest of the string using the MID and LEN functions.
After doing this my dates were clean and uniform.
I also had some empty cells because of the "Text to Columns" feature I had the 'Last Date' empty for some that had only 1 date initially.
To fix this i issue I used this formula: =IF(ISBLANK(j2), i2, j2)
This formula checks if j2 is blank. If it is, it returns the value of i2. If it's not, it returns the value of j2.
I changed the format of the cells to date, to match the '21 Jan 1930' format I already had.
I also created a new column name 'Length' to calculate the length of an event.
As you can guess I got the length of an event by subtracting the 'Original Date' from the 'Last Date'.
In Excel this formula is simply =(j2-i2). This game me the length of each event.
	I didn't end up visualizing Lenght but I have the information if I ever need to use it in the future.

Cleaning & Preparing the Books Data before importing it into Tableau 

Converted the books.csv to Excel workbook

To remove all instances of this I used the replace function to find Â throughout my Excel file & replace it with a space. 
	This process cleaned up my sheet and made the words more uniform & recognizable.
I used the 'TRIM' function to remove leading and trailing spaces because we were dealing with authors' & reviewers' names which need to be specific.
The formula in Excel to trim is simply =TRIM(C2)
I wanted to visualize people who wrote & reviewed more than 2 books involving world war II.
So i used conditional formatting to highlight cells with the Duplicated Values.
Then I filtered by the color these cells were highlighted in.
This allowed me to view only the names which repeated more than once.
Then i sorted in descending order to see the names.
Doing this I noticed some names were repeated with different variations and would therefore be stored as two different people.
For example: Gordon Rottman in one cell & Gordon L. Rottman in another
This is the same man but in Tableau they will be visualized as two different people.
So to change this I changed all instances of Gordon Rottman to Gordon L. Rottman to accurately represent this data.


Cleaning & Preparing the Books Aircraft before importing into Tableau 

Converted the aircraft.csv to an Excel workbook
	Tableau does not accept CSV files but accepts Excel files.
Created a table in Excel with headers.
"Â" was present in every cell at the end of every word.
To remove all instances of this I used the replace function to find Â throughout my Excel file & replace it with a space. 
	This process cleaned up my sheet and made the words more uniform & recognizable.


These were files that had no place to join them as all files were different.
I imported to Tableau separately & without joining them.
